# Queue

The given code is an implementation of a basic queue data structure using an array. It supports enqueue and dequeue operations along with some helper functions.

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code begins with the inclusion of the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes most of the standard library headers. It is not recommended to include this file in practice because it's not a standard header.

2. The variable `Max_size` is declared and set to 5, indicating the maximum size of the queue.

3. The function `isempty` takes pointers to the `front` and `rear` variables and checks if the queue is empty. It returns `true` if both `front` and `rear` are -1, indicating an empty queue; otherwise, it returns `false`.

4. The function `isfull` takes a pointer to the `rear` variable and checks if the queue is full. It returns `true` if the `rear` value is greater than or equal to `Max_size - 1`, indicating a full queue; otherwise, it returns `false`.

5. The function `top` takes the queue array `q` and a pointer to the `front` variable. It prints the value at the front of the queue and indicates that it is going to be dequeued.

6. The function `display` takes the queue array `q` and pointers to the `front` and `rear` variables. It prints all the elements in the queue if the queue is not empty. It loops from the `front` to the `rear` and prints each element.

7. The function `enqueue` takes the queue array `q`, pointers to the `front` and `rear` variables, and the value to be enqueued. It checks if the queue is full using the `isfull` function. If the queue is full, it prints a message indicating that the queue is full. Otherwise, if the queue is empty, it sets the `front` and `rear` to 0 and enqueues the value. Otherwise, it increments the `rear` and enqueues the value.

8. The function `dequeue` takes the queue array `q` and pointers to the `front` and `rear` variables. It checks if the queue is empty using the `isempty` function. If the queue is empty, it prints a message indicating that the queue is empty. Otherwise, if the `front` and `rear` are equal, it calls the `top` function to print the front element and dequeues it. It then sets the `front` and `rear` to -1 to indicate an empty queue. Otherwise, it calls the `top` function to print the front element and increments the `front`.

9. In the `main` function, an array `q` of size `Max_size` is declared to store the queue elements, and the `front` and `rear` variables are initialized to -1, indicating an empty queue.

10. Five elements are enqueued using the `enqueue` function.

11. The `display` function is called to print the elements in the queue.

12. Two elements are dequeued using the `dequeue` function.

13. The `display` function is called again to print the updated elements in the queue.

14. Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

Overall, the code implements a basic queue using an array and performs enqueue and dequeue operations. The helper functions check if the queue is empty or full and display the elements in the queue.

# Circular Queue

This is a C++ program that implements a circular queue using an array. Let's go through the code and understand how it works.

1. The code includes the necessary header files and defines the maximum size of the circular queue to be 5.

2. The `isempty` function checks if the queue is empty. It returns `true` if both the front and rear pointers are -1, indicating an empty queue, and `false` otherwise.

3. The `top` function prints the front element of the queue that is going to be dequeued.

4. The `display` function prints all the elements in the queue. It starts from the front pointer and iterates until it reaches the rear pointer, wrapping around if necessary due to the circular nature of the queue.

5. The `enqueue` function inserts an element into the circular queue. If the queue is empty, it sets both the front and rear pointers to 0 and inserts the element. If the queue is not empty, it checks if the next position of the rear pointer (modulo Max_size) is equal to the front pointer. If it is, the queue is full, and an error message is displayed. Otherwise, it increments the rear pointer (modulo Max_size) and inserts the element at that position.

6. The `dequeue` function removes an element from the circular queue. If the queue is empty, it displays an error message. If the front and rear pointers are equal, it means there is only one element in the queue, so the `top` function is called to display and dequeue that element. After dequeuing, both the front and rear pointers are set to -1 to indicate an empty queue. If there are multiple elements in the queue, the `top` function is called to display and dequeue the front element, and the front pointer is incremented (modulo Max_size).

7. In the `main` function, a circular queue is created using an array `q` of size `Max_size`. The front and rear pointers are initialized as -1 to indicate an empty queue. Several enqueue and dequeue operations are performed on the queue, and the state of the queue is displayed after each operation.

Overall, this code implements a basic circular queue using an array and provides functions to enqueue, dequeue, display the elements, and check if the queue is empty or full.
